Large language models (LLM) are renowned for their ability to process long text sequences. 
However, when dealing with lengthy articles, books, or prolonged chat sessions, these models often reach their context limit. 
This poses a challenge when the need arises to extend the context of the model to even longer sequences. 
Current solutions to this problem are either computationally demanding, memory-intensive, or imprecise. 
A breakthrough solution is StreamingLLM, developed by a collaborative team of researchers from Meta AI, MIT, and Carnegie Mellon University.
 This innovative technique can extend an LLM’s context to millions of tokens without the need for vast compute and memory resources, 
 all while preserving the model’s high-quality performance. 
 StreamingLLM is poised to be an invaluable tool for applications that require long-sequence text processing.
